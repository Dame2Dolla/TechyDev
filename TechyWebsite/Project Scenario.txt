As a Business Analyst I liaised with my client and project manager to produce a list of requirements for the project such as all functional and non-functional requirements for the project. But first we had to look at our competition and what functions they implemented into their platform because the customer wanted to produce something like LinkedIn and Facebook, but the only difference is that the target audience is going to be University students, they can use this just like LinkedIn and Facebook, but the content will be more about schools, Universities and focused on educational content.

The Project Manager and I did research on our competition "LinkedIn" and "Facebook" we listed most of the common functions that each platform provided and that was used by the users and wanted to implement it in our own platform called "Student Mind". After we analysed the functions that "LinkedIn" and "Facebook" provided and finalized what our product backlog of functional and non-functional requirements is going to look like.
